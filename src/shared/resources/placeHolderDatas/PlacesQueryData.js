Long story short, the people of Austin voted in early 2016 to expand background checks for the drivers and both Uber and Lyft bolted. But in May 2017, the Governor signed new legislation to limit background checks, and Uber and Lyft returned immediately. If you want to use a rideshare service you can use Uber, Lyft, Fasten, Wingz, GetMe, Fare, Hail a Cab, InstaRyde or RideAustin. Personally, I use Fasten.        "
